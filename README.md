# ahua_cmput301_assignment1

This is the README for ahua's cmput 301 assignment 1

The application has the following functionalities:
The user can view the main screen that contains records added during the current run of the application
(The application is not persistent)
Upon clicking the floating action button in the bottom right corner (designed by Amy Hua)
The user can fill fields with size information to keep a record.
Upon clicking save, the Name only will be saved and the user can view this name in the main screen.

To be honest, this application is lacking most of the functionalities requested but much effort
has been put into it. Unsuccessful attempts at implementing data persistence and using Parcelable
to pass record objects between activities have been commented out.

Please enjoy and look forward to a brighter future in ahua's android application making :)
